Hello Alessandro,

    Are you going to charge the attendees some token amount?

    Are you promoting this event?

    Are folks able to register, and pay in advance?

    How many folks have confirmed their attendance?

    Where is this being advertised?

    These are important data points for me to present to the marketing
organization at Novell.  

    I think I can get some money, but we can definitely not cover
everything.

Miguel
